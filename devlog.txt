=== Development Log ===

[2024-03-20] Initial Project Setup
- Created basic roguelike game structure
- Design decisions:
  * Used monospace font for consistent character display
  * Chose dark theme (black background, white text) for better visibility
  * Set default game area to 20x10 for a reasonable viewing size
  * Used ASCII characters for game elements:
    - '@' for player character
    - '#' for walls
    - '.' for floor tiles

[2024-03-20] Game Mechanics Implementation
- Implemented core movement system:
  * Arrow key controls for intuitive navigation
  * Collision detection with walls
  * Player starts in center of game area
- Technical decisions:
  * Used CSS grid for centered layout
  * Implemented game state using a class-based approach
  * Used textContent for rendering to maintain simplicity
  * Chose pre-formatted text (white-space: pre) for consistent grid display

[2024-03-20] Code Organization
- Split code into two files:
  * index.html: Contains layout and styling
  * game.js: Contains game logic and rendering
- Created this devlog.txt file to track development decisions

[2024-03-20] Floor Navigation System
- Added multi-floor dungeon system:
  * Implemented floor tracking and display
  * Added stairs up '<' and down '>'
  * Created floor generation system
- Design decisions:
  * Floor 1 starts with only down stairs
  * New floors generate with both up and down stairs
  * Player spawns near entry stairs for continuity
  * Used Map data structure for floor management
  * Stairs positioned at 1/4 and 3/4 of room dimensions for balanced layout
- Controls added:
  * '<' key to go upstairs when on '<' tile
  * '>' key to go downstairs when on '>' tile

[2024-03-20] Randomized Stair Positioning
- Enhanced floor generation system:
  * Added random positioning for stairs on each floor
  * Implemented position memory for consistent floor layouts
  * Created stair connection system between floors
- Technical improvements:
  * Added position validation to prevent stair overlap
  * Implemented exact stair position matching between floors
  * Enhanced player positioning logic when changing floors
- Design decisions:
  * Stairs maintain their position when returning to a floor
  * Connected stairs (up/down) share the same x/y coordinates
  * Player appears next to arrival stairs for better orientation

[2024-03-20] Stair Navigation Fix
- Corrected stair navigation behavior:
  * Player now appears exactly at the corresponding stair position when changing floors
  * Removed offset positioning when arriving on new floors
  * Fixed player position handling for existing floors
- Design decisions:
  * Maintained exact x,y coordinates between connected stairs
  * Simplified player positioning logic
  * Improved navigation consistency between floors

[2024-03-20] Stair Type Alternation
- Implemented alternating stair system:
  * Every floor now has both up '<' and down '>' stairs
  * Using down stairs on one floor leads to up stairs on next floor
  * Using up stairs on one floor leads to down stairs on next floor
- Technical improvements:
  * Removed special case for floor 1 (now has both stair types)
  * Enhanced stair generation to ensure non-overlapping positions
  * Fixed player positioning to match stair type alternation
- Design decisions:
  * Maintained consistent stair positions between connected floors
  * Ensured each floor has both stair types for navigation options
  * Created more interesting vertical exploration possibilities

[2024-03-20] Maze Generation System
- Implemented procedural maze generation:
  * Added random wall placement with spacing constraints
  * Created guaranteed pathways between stairs
  * Implemented collision detection with walls
- Technical features:
  * Used breadth-first search for pathfinding
  * Added wall density control (30% coverage)
  * Implemented path widening algorithm
- Design decisions:
  * Protected areas around stairs from wall placement
  * Created wider corridors for better navigation
  * Ensured all paths are reachable
  * Maintained maze consistency when revisiting floors

[2024-03-20] Enhanced Maze Generation
- Improved wall generation algorithm:
  * Implemented multi-pass wall growth system
  * Added wall connectivity rules
  * Enhanced corridor generation
- Technical improvements:
  * Created initial wall seeds (10% coverage)
  * Added wall growth based on adjacency
  * Implemented wall cleanup for isolated segments
- Design decisions:
  * Increased protected area around stairs
  * Reduced path widening probability
  * Created more natural-looking wall structures
  * Maintained navigable spaces between walls

[2024-03-20] Code Modularization
- Separated floor generation logic:
  * Created new floorGenerator.js module
  * Implemented WallGenerator class for wall generation
  * Implemented FloorGenerator class for floor management
- Technical improvements:
  * Converted to ES6 modules
  * Improved code organization and separation of concerns
  * Enhanced maintainability and testability
- Design decisions:
  * Separated wall generation into distinct component
  * Created clear interfaces between modules
  * Maintained existing functionality while improving structure
